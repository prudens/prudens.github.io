### Education 

__2002.9~2006.7:__ HeBei University of Science & Technology, Mechanical Design
Manufacturing and Automation, Bachelor's Degree.

When I was studying in the college , I was such a good student, worked hard
for gaining a merit scholarship every year and tried my best to have various
qualification certificates as many as possible. All the stuff I won during
the four years were shown in the following list:  
 
 - English CET4, CET6 
 - NCRE Level II (C), Level III (IM)
 - a three-year merit scholarship winner
 - a three-year honor roll student 

Because of my major (Automation), Microcomputer Principle was one of our
required courses, so I had a chance to learn Assembly language after I knew C
language. Meanwhile C++, VB and VC were our selective courses. It was all my
experience with computer language, and I had no idea my profession would be
related with programming one day.

__2007.9~2010.3:__ North China Electric Power University, Dropout.

Compared with my college life, the life in NCEPU was totally different. I was
not a good student any more since I payed much more attention to do what I
wanted to do. Actually I wasn't interested in my research subject, which used
[Labview][labview] to simulate all the fault conditions of a steam turbine in
a power plant. It was boring and valueless I thought. I couldn't waste my time
again. I eagerly wanted to learn a really useful skill. 

Luckily, in the second year in the NCEPU I got to know Linux, and I found the
right thing I would love to do. The life was tough but exciting. What I did as
follows: 

 - Linux (Ubuntu) platform [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/) development
 - C++ as main language 
 - Do device driver writing, based on 2.6 kernel for Samsung s3c2410 ARM chip.
