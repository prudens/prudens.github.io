    <p>Luckily, Steven finally took part in the <a href="http://www.happyec.org">English Corner</a>,
and reached there in time. He had his hair cut off, so he looked more
energetic and younger than the last time we met him. On the other hand, almost
no students knew this activity, peter just announced the event on his small
website only with 10 users, so that I had to tell all of the customers of the
Bookbar Cafe to join our group. The good news was nearly every customer was
interested in speaking English with a foreigner, and we got more than six
people to talk with Steven.</p>

<p>Steven spoke English with real American accent and clearly, so it sounded very
comfortable. You know the most of Chinese students were not good at listening
and speaking, no exception of us, meantimes Steven spoke would speak very
quickly when he answered someone’s questions, therefore students couldn’t
fully understand what he said, except that some student translated his words
into Chinese, but we all tried our best to listen to him, after all this was a
good chance to speak English face to face with a foreigner.</p>

<p>The time passed so quickly. Two hours later, we said goodbye to Steven. As far
as I can concerned, the whole talk was very happy, active and relaxing, and I
found my English level was much better than before.</p>
