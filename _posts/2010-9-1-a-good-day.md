It's a nice, really nice day! The day is so pretty that I hope it would
never be gone. I hope every day was wonderful as it is. Bright sunshine, 
soft and warm breeze, lovely birds and relaxed people, attractive flowers and 
green leaves. What a beautiful picture!
The nature is magic! Yesterday was extremely windy from afternoon to night, but
today is so nice!
You will see a rainbow after experience rain and storm. Maybe good things
always go with bads.
