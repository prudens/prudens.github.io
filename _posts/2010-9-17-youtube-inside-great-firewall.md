I want to access _YouTube_ , but it is blocked in China. Is there any method
to jump over the Great Firewall? Luckily, I found a good website
<http://deturl.com/> through which you can download videos from _YouTube_.

### install tools

When you open homepage of the website, click the small icon in top right
corner of the screen, then a dialog appears. If you click the add button, a
search plugin will be installed by Firefox. You can find it in the list of
search engines available in the search bar.

### search URL

After you have installed the search bar tool. The next step is to find URL of
the video that you want to download from YouTube. How can you do this? You can
use a search engine that you prefer to get their URL. For example, if you need
some videos about _Git_, you just type `site: youtube git` (there is a space
following "`:`") in Google search bar, then Google will display all the
relating items. Click a proper item, a new window will be opened. Of course,
there is nothing to be displayed except some error messages, but the selected
video URL is in the address bar.

### download video

When get the right video URL, copy it from the address bar, then paste it to
the search bar of Deturl. The most important thing is to type `pwn` before
`youtube` in the search bar(so you finally have sth like
`http://www.pwnyoutube.com/watch?v=VnakEiPzPs8`) and hit enter. A web page
shows up, including much powerful function. Below the subtitle `Download the
video as FLV or MP4 files`, click `Dirpy` in the first line, the real web page
where you can download the video will appear. Select a video format available,
then the video will be downloaded from _YouTube_ .

### enjoy it
